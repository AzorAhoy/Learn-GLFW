# C++ GLFW Development Workspace for Visual Studio Code

This repository is a VS Code workspace template for a simple C++ application that uses the [GLFW library] (https://www.glfw.org/). For anyone preferring a lightweight editor to develop C++ OpenGL graphics/games applications using the GLFW library, this VS Code workspace is a basic starting point. The workspace and configuration can be extended and modified in any way required.

### Prerequisites
- Its assumed you already have an installed instance of VS Code up and running
- You have MinGW installed in your machine
- The 'Windows pre-compiled binaries' are downloaded from the [GLFW downloads page] (https://www.glfw.org/download.html)
- Extracting the file downloaded from above step, the GLFW folder found inside the include folder should be copied to 'MinGW\include' in your local machine (i.e. in my case I copied the contents of **fw-3.2.1.bin.WIN32\include\** into **MinGW\include**)
